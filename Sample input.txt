In Remix IDE, ensure you have your smart contract loaded.

Select the contract and the function you want to call (e.g., addPatient).

Input the values in the "Value" field for each parameter of the function. For example:

_name: "John Doe"
_age: 35
_gender: ["Male"]
_conditions: ["Diabetes", "Hypertension"]
_allergies: ["Peanuts", "Penicillin"]
_medications: ["Insulin", "Aspirin"]
_procedures: ["Appendectomy"]
Make sure you have an Ethereum wallet connected (for example, MetaMask).

Click the "Transact" or "Send Transaction" button to execute the function, which will send the input values to the smart contract.

These input values would be added to the smart contract as part of the transaction when you call the addPatient function.

Please note that you need to be connected to an Ethereum network (e.g., a local development network or a testnet) and have some test Ether in your account to perform these transactions in Remix IDE.
